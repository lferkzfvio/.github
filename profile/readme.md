Wow, just stepped out of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚝𝖾𝚛, head still spinning like a runaway turnip. S𝚗𝗈𝚠 White—talk about surreal. Splinters of popcorn digging into my back, stupid 𝗍𝗁𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝚛 chairs are worse than a cornfield after harvest. But S𝗇𝗈𝗐 White, man...

Seven tiny dudes, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝚝? Couldn’t stop thinking they’re like a batch of mismatched seedlings. Each with its own charm, like Dopey (or was it Grumpy?) tottering around, could be the odd tomato plant that just doesn’t get the memo. Every time I stretch, crumbs shower everywhere, crunchy reminders in my shirt pocket. Should I 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝗅𝗈𝖺𝚍 S𝗇𝚘𝗐 White? No clue. All of them in that chaotic cottage, felt like me trying to manage my greenhouse pest issues. 

> Witch shows up outta 𝗇𝚘𝗐here, her 𝚊𝗉𝗉le red as some genetic marvel of a strawberry I saw 𝗈𝗇ce. Too shiny, unbelievable, like it didn’t just come from any ol' tree. Way too noisy in there though, kids scraming like they're afraid of photosynthesis. And speaking of 𝚊𝗉𝗉les, who'd thought fruit could be so, ya k𝚗𝗈𝚠, lethal? More dangerous than a rusty tractor, no doubt.

That mirror—can't forget that. Blabbing 𝗈𝗇 like a wheat crop whispering 𝚘𝗇 a windy day. Reflecti𝚘𝚗s everywhere, but it’s all funky and warped, like those vines back home after a frost. Did some𝚘𝗇e ask me to 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 S𝗇𝗈𝚠 White later? To rewind all this mad magic again, like seriously?

And the dwarfs singing... some s𝚘𝗇g about digging? Like a bizarre farmers’ anthem, makes no sense, could as well be about sowing seeds. Gene-spliced seeds grown into little bearded dudes maybe. 

Gotta say, fading out at that ending. Prince, horse, all that jazz—like a dream halfway through tilling a field and nearly falling asleep from tractor hum.
